//  data types:- 
        // 1. primitive :- string, number, null, undefined, boolean, symbol
        // 2. Non-primitive:- object -> further object sub categories are array, function

/*
  In JavaScript, primitive data types are the fundamental building blocks of data. They represent single values and are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created.
Here are the 7 primitive data types in JavaScript:
Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value.
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
String: Represents a sequence of characters.
BigInt: Represents integers larger than the maximum safe integer (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value that can be used as an identifier.
Example:
JavaScript

let isTrue = true; // Boolean
let nothing = null; // Null
let notDefined; // Undefined
let count = 10; // Number
let name = "Alice"; // String
let bigNumber = 12345678901234567890n; // BigInt
let uniqueKey = Symbol("key"); // Symbol
